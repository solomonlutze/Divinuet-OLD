  cardLongDescription: "Strength: perseverance, growth, courage.\n\nStrength is almost
    always represented as a figure taming a wild animal.^ This card represents one\u2019s
    ability to manage anxieties, distress, and negative forces when they are willing
    to directly address them^ rather than hiding away trying to avoid them.^ Have
    the courage to engage with the parts of yourself you don\u2019t like as much.^
    As they say, what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger."
  cardShortDescription: perseverance, growth, courage
